## Adding, Removing and Viewing Items

The system should allow customers to add, remove, and view items from their cart. When displaying the items, the system should show the name, price, and quantity of the items.

## Viewing Total Price

The system should allow customers to view the total price of their cart. The total price should be updated whenever modifications are made to the cart.

## Modifying Item Quantity

The system should allow customers to increase and decrease the quantity of items in their cart.

## Adding Items with Different Options

The system should allow customers to add items with different options and prices. For example, a customer can add a bottle of water of 500ml or 1L. The price will vary based on the selected option.

## Viewing Total Price Based on Store Location

The system should allow customers to view the total price of their cart based on the store they are shopping from. For example, if a customer is buying an item from the store in Spain, the price will be lower than if they are buying the same item from the store in Singapore.
